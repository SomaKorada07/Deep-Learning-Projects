# Deep Learning Projects

### Neural Networks using Tensorflow: 
The following figure shows the current hierarchy of TensorFlow toolkits (source: Google Devel ML Course):

![TensorFlow toolkit hierarchy](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/images/TFHierarchy.svg)

* Basics of Tensorfow
* MNIST data using basic customizable graph session (Perceptron model) approach
* IRIS data using Tensorflow estimators object approach
* Bank Note Authentication data using Tensorflow estimators object approach
* Apple Stock Price Movement Predictions for 30 days window using LSTM Model using TensorFlow model

### Supervised Neural Networks using Keras:
* Predicting Losing Bank Customers (Classification) using keras Library 
* Image Recognition using Convolutional Neural Networks of keras Library (Couldn't finish in PC due to low computing framework, but completed it using Google Cloud platform)
* Time Series Analysis using Keras, Google Stock Price movement prediction for 1 day window using LSTM RNN Model

### Un-Supervised Neural Networks using PyTorch:
* Hybrid Deep Learning Model (Self Organized Maps then Neural Networks) for detection and then prediction of credit card defaulter
* Restricted Boltzmann Machines for Movie Recommendation System (Like or Dislike)
* Sparse AutoEncoders for Movie Recommendation System (1 to 5 rating)
